I currently offer two standardized types of lesson:
 
* One-hour (US$ 30) or 30-minute (US$15) lesson focused mainly on conversation. This is recommended for those with an intermediate/advanced level of Spanish who want a fun and safe space to practice. During these calls, we get together and basically chat. I’ll look for special materials to suit your particular interests and help you with your communication skills so you can feel confident when interacting in Spanish. As we speak, you’ll be also able to polish your pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

* One-hour lesson (US$ 35) recommended for beginners. Here, you’ll learn Spanish from scratch with a communicative approach.  I’ll help you understand how the language system works: we’ll talk about some very basic grammar concepts that will simplify your life and you will slowly be exposed to more and more vocabulary. You’ll learn about the different varieties of Spanish and eventually become a Spanish speaker yourself.
 
If you are preparing for an exam or if you have another specific need, I can come up with a tailored plan! Book a [free 15-minute meeting](https://calendly.com/tamaramathov) or send me an email to [tamaramathov@gmail.com](tamaramathov@gmail.com) telling me about your requirements.
