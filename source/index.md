Hi there! My name is Tamara. I’m from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I'm a Spanish teacher.
 
I studied Language and Literature at Buenos Aires University, and I have over 10 years of experience in teaching Spanish as a second language.
 
I started teaching online in 2013. Although I still enjoy working with students face to face, I believe that online tutoring is the most effective method of long-term learning.
 
By working remotely, I was able to travel around South America until 2017, when I settled in Buenos Aires. This experience not only showed me the big picture of different lifestyles and cultures, but also means I have a first-hand approach to different forms of contemporary Spanish.
 
Besides being a language nerd, I am also interested in science, politics, feminism, and fiction – really, knowledge in general! What I like the most is hearing stories, and learning about new points of view and life experiences. I believe that all my students learn a lot during our time together, but that I learn from them as well. The most beautiful thing about my work is the transformation that happens within our interactions.
